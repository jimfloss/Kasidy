# Kasidy

A base WordPress Plugin used to extend the capabilities of any WordPress Theme tailored to the work that I do on a daily basis. This plugin supports the programmatic creation of custom post types, and custom taxonomies in a simple and straight forward OOP fashion. This plugin will also house reusable modules (shortcodes) as the project evolves. There will be no CSS/SCSS stored in this project outside of the Bootstrap Grid. Again the goal of all of my projects is to improve code reusability, project load time, programmatically increase project SEO value and provide the best user experience in the least amount of time utilizing forward thinking code methodologies and beautiful code.

## Dependencies

* Bootstrap Grid v4.0.0
* jQuery (1.12.4+)

## Modules
